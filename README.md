## Getting Started...
The raspberry pi is a single board computer. This means everything the board requires for computing is on the board(RAM , CPU , Wifi Chip etc). Although, to interact with the board, we need some kind of input or output , just to know what's going inside. Notice the ports arranged on the board. That is how we interact with the raspberry pi. In this project I will not be using a keyboard and mouse directly connected to the pi. Rather, I'll be using a Remote client (VNC Viewer) on my PC to connect and control my raspberry pi. Find out how to set up VNC with the raspbery pi using this link.
